ModLib:
    ServerOptions.MyOptions only supports integers for values. In particular, strings are impossible to store.

    Registry only supports one loaded mod at a time; If multiple mods reference ModLib, the first mod registered is used for metadata purposes.
        Fixed!

    Use LogUtils for ModLib's Core.Logger instance; Allow other mods to mirror ModLib's output into their own logs
        Done? Unsure on how to implement the latter.
        Done!

    ServerOptions is not synced in an online context; Instead, the client's MyOptions is cleared entirely.

    Core.PatchLoader._latestPatcherVersion could be assigned at compile-time, somehow. Would help a lot with not forgetting to change it after an update.

    ServerOptions.ToString() should be more descriptive, but not too verbose. Acronyms worked great for single-mod projects, but as a library, either properly display options or abstract it away entirely.

AscendedSaint:
    Player sees their own name in the ascension/revival messages, instead of the actual ascended/revived target.

    Reviving an online creature causes both the owner and the caller to attempt running the revival method; The creature is not revived.

    Self-ascension is disabled in an online lobby, regardless of the client or host's settings (possibly due to above ServerOptions issue)
    Ascension effects are also not played; None of the aforementioned issues occur in singleplayer.
        A potential fix has been provided; Playtest is pending.
