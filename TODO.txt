ModLib:
    Core.PatchLoader._latestPatcherVersion could be assigned at compile-time, somehow. Would help a lot with not forgetting to change it after an update.

    Potentially have an individual ServerOptions instance per registered mod?
    Meadow sync would only be performed for mods which are present on both ends; ModLib could send a SoftRPC first to request the host for their list of enabled ModLib mods.

    LogUtilsHelper should have as little ModLib-specific branches as possible; ModLib should be treated as a regular consumer of its own API

    Add log buffering for FallbackLogger

    Known issue: Core.MyData.DevToolsActive (and thus OptionUtils.IsOptionEnabled("modlib.debug")) may be an incorrect value until Core is initialized;
    Mods can still interact with a non-fully initialized ModLib by calling code in their plugin's .ctor(), which may cause unexpected behavior until Core.Initialize() is called

AscendedSaint:
    Player sees their own name in the ascension/revival messages, instead of the actual ascended/revived target.

    Reviving an online creature causes both the owner and the caller to attempt running the revival method; The creature is not revived.

    Self-ascension is disabled in an online lobby, regardless of the client or host's settings (possibly due to above ServerOptions issue)
    Ascension effects are also not played; None of the aforementioned issues occur in singleplayer.
        A potential fix has been provided; Playtest is pending.
        Fix is not enough; Now the game freezes waiting for the creature's revival. Non-players don't work either.
